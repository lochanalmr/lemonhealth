# LemonHealth
Command line based health calculator made with ‘Python’ which can calculate various health functions and classify the results according to various standards by WHO and other international organizations using age/gender/regional data inputs and gives health advice related to the classification data outputs from the program.

**Currently supported functions:-**
1. BMI (Body Mass Index)
2. BAI (Body Adiposity Index)
3. WHR (Waist to Hip Ratio)
4. MM (MultiMeasure)

MultiMeasure is a special feature built into LemonHealth, to calculate all supported health functions at once, without repeated input of the same data. It is useful when you need to track health progress, with all the data in one view.
The functionality to export health data in .txt files, will be introduced soon.
